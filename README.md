<h1 align="center">Skyloong Monitor Server</h1>

A lightweight, cross-platform server application that monitors system resources and provides real-time CPU and memory usage data to Skyloong keyboard displays.

#### TESTED ONLY ON SKYLOONG GK104 PRO

## Features
- 🚀 **Real-time monitoring** of CPU and memory usage
- ⌨ **Data transmission** to compatible Skyloong keyboard displays
- 🖥 **System tray integration** for minimal desktop footprint
- 🌗 **Dark/light theme support**
- 🛠 **Debug mode** for troubleshooting
- 🔄 **Daemon mode** for automatic startup

---

## How It Works

### 🏗 Data Collection
The server uses `psutil` to collect real-time system information:
- **CPU usage percentage** across all cores
- **Memory usage percentage**

### 📡 Data Transmission
- **Connection Protocol:** The server listens on **TCP port 1648** and accepts connections from compatible keyboard devices.
- **Data Format:** System information is transmitted as an **8-byte data packet**:
  - **First 4 bytes:** CPU usage as a floating-point number *(0.0-1.0)*
  - **Last 4 bytes:** Memory usage as a floating-point number *(0.0-1.0)*

#### 🔄 Communication Flow:
1. **Server sends** the 8-byte data packet to connected clients
2. **Client responds** with a 1-byte acknowledgment
3. **Cycle repeats** approximately **3 times per second**

### 🤝 Client Handling
- Each client connection is handled in a **separate thread**
- The server can handle **multiple simultaneous connections** (MAX 5)
- When a client disconnects, **resources are properly cleaned up**
